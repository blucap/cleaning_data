# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Coursera
#### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is my submission for  Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my ability to  collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy  data that can be used for later analysis. 

The repository contains:

- a tidy data set as described below
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any  transformations or work performed to clean up the data called  CodeBook.md. 
- this README.md 
- `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
- a script that downloads the data (download_and_unzip_data_files)
- a script that processes the data (process_data.R)
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each  subject.
- The final data **TidyData.txt**.
- The second data set **StatsData.txt**.

#### Blurb

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article ](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the  most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from  the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
